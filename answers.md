Question 1: If you only had 200 labeled replies, how would you improve the model without collecting thousands more? 

I would use data augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, back-translation, and template-based generation to expand the dataset and to label the data I'd employ semi-supervised learning

Question 2: How would you ensure your reply classifier doesn't produce biased or unsafe outputs in production? 

I would implement bias testing with diverse demographic text samples and use techniques like adversarial debiasing during training. For safer outputs, I'd add content filters to catch inappropriate language and implement confidence thresholds to route low-confidence predictions for human review. Regular monitoring with A/B testing and feedback loops would help detect and correct issues after deployment.

Question 3: Suppose you want to generate personalized cold email openers using an LLM. What prompt design strategies would you use to keep outputs relevant and non-generic? 

I would go for few-shot prompting with successful email examples and include specific prospect context (industry, role, pain points) in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting would help the LLM reason about personalization steps. Additionally, I'd implement constraint-based generation that requires inclusion of prospect-specific details and A/B testing of different prompt templates to optimize for engagement metrics.
